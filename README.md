# Multiclass-image-classification-using-tensorflow
In this project we classify images on basis of their object. There are 10 objects in the dataset we are using in this project.  
The data set we use in this project is called cifar10. As the name suggests it contains 10 class and 6000 images.  

Models Used:  
-
* Convolution layer  
* Dense Layer
* Adam optimizer
* Dropout
* Flatten

Additional feature:  
-  
* I have also created a gui using Tkinter with which we can acces the classifier module and classify the images.
* Prediction accuracy: 68%
